Now that Steve Jobs has passed away at the age of 56, take a moment and grieve. After that period has passed, reflect. Reflect on the state of Microsoft after Bill Gates left and dedicated the majority of his time to his foundation. Reflect on the state of Dell Computers when Michael Dell left. There was a reason he came back. And now Apple has lost it's leader as well. The original three from Apple are no longer there. What does the future hold? New Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has been critized for the lack of pop in his presentation earlier this week. If this is any indication of the future, what does this do to the state of Apple?

Let's see how this affects stocks over the next few weeks.
