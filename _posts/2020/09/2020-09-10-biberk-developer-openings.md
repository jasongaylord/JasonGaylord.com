I'm hiring! I continue to have [new openings](https://jasong.us/3m4UVFS) for developers on my team. I'm looking for developers that are proficient in at least two of the following areas:

* .NET Core
* ASP.NET MVC
* Angular
* TypeScript
* Azure native app development

While the title posted may be misleading, if any of the above are related to your experience, apply to the **.NET Developer** position at: [jasong.us/3m4UVFS](https://jasong.us/3m4UVFS)
