I'm hiring an Umbraco Developer for our growing team. This position is for biBerk, a direct insurance company. I'm looking for someone who can demonstrate sound experience with Umbraco and .NET. We're looking for someone interested in working in a dynamic, fast paced organization. As a developer on our team, you will create cutting edge functionality and help to enable our team to be cloud-first. This position may also involve consultative work for other Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries.
