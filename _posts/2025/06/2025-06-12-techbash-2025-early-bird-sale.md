It's time to register for **TechBash 2025**. 3-day and 4-day early bird tickets are now available on [techbash.com](https://jasong.us/43XkZtc).

We're back this fall, in-person, at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg). Join us November 4-7 for great keynotes, workshops, sessions, food, swag, and the best water slides in the Northeast U.S. Register soon because early bird rates are valid only through June 30th, 2025. At that point, ticket prices increase by $100 so, it **SAVES** to register early.

Get more information about our speakers, sponsors, hotel rooms, and more on [techbash.com](https://jasong.us/tb).

Want to send your dev team? Reach out to TechBash to ask about discounts for groups of five or more.

In addition, get your room at the Kalahari starting at just $169 a night for each night you choose to stay between Monday, November 3rd and Friday, November 7th. [Click here for complete details](https://jasong.us/hotelreg). That's right. That's $15 cheaper than last year's event!
