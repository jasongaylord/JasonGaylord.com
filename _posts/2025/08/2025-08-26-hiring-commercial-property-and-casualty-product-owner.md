I recently opened up a new [Commercial & Property Casualty Product Owner](https://jasong.us/3JjX1Su) role at biBerk. This role centers on leading the development and evolution of Commercial Property & Casualty insurance products, with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance across all U.S. jurisdictions. The Product Owner will define and manage the product roadmap, ensuring alignment with business goals and market trends. They will serve as the key liaison between business stakeholders and technology teams, translating complex insurance concepts into actionable system requirements and driving enhancements that reflect the intricacies of Workers Compensation, Commercial Auto, BOP, General Liability, and E&O products.

Collaboration is a core component of the position, requiring close engagement with actuarial, underwriting, claims, compliance, and development teams. The candidate will facilitate workshops, gather insights, and prioritize user stories and business rules to ensure the product meets both operational needs and regulatory standards. They will also monitor performance and user feedback to identify opportunities for continuous improvement and innovation, while maintaining thorough documentation of product features and workflows.

The ideal candidate will bring at least seven years of experience in Commercial P&C insurance, a bachelorâ€™s degree in a related field, and preferably actuarial credentials such as ASA, ACAS, or FCAS. Familiarity with Agile methodologies and tools like Jira or Azure DevOps is essential, along with strong communication and stakeholder management skills. Additional qualifications such as a CPCU or agent license, experience in digital transformation, and the ability to lead cross-functional teams without direct authority are highly valued.
