I recently opened up a new [Lead Integration Architect](http://jasong.us/4oHf6de) role at biBerk. This position is a remote or hybrid position. The company, part of Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company, is building a cloud-first, API-driven insurance platform. The Lead Integration Architect will be responsible for designing and developing secure, scalable APIs that connect .NET services to external platforms. This includes implementing security protocols and ensuring high performance and reliability. The architect will collaborate with cross-functional teams, mentor developers, and troubleshoot integration issues.

Candidates must have at least seven years of experience in software development using C#, with strong knowledge of RESTful APIs, OpenAPI, JSON/XML, and API security. Preferred qualifications include experience with microservices, Azure, Docker, and third-party platform integrations.

The position comes with a competitive compensation package, generous time off, healthcare benefits, a 401(k) match, tuition reimbursement, and opportunities for growth and service recognition.

If you're interested, please reach out to me directly via email or via [LinkedIn](http://jasong.us/4mgaBoo).
