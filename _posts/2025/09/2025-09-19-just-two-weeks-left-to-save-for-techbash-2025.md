In just two more weeks, the pricing for **TechBash 2025** increases. We are currently in the _Standard Pricing_ period, but starting on October 4th, pricing will increase $100 for all ticket types during the _Late Bird Pricing_ period. So, what are you waiting for? Register today at [techbash.com](https://jasong.us/43XkZtc). 

TechBash 2025, held November 4–7 at Kalahari Resorts in Pocono Manor, PA, is packed with forward-thinking content for developers. This year’s keynotes include Nicole Tibaldi’s talk, *“Eat Your Vegetables: Prioritizing the Health of Your Engineering Team,”* which explores how to advocate for essential but often deprioritized engineering tasks like documentation and test coverage. Kevin Griffin will also deliver a keynote on the *State of the .NET Foundation and .NET Open Source*, joined by Microsoft’s Jeff Fritz to discuss community involvement and new projects within the .NET ecosystem.

The workshop lineup is equally robust, offering deep dives into CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipelines, Dependency Injection in C#, PostgreSQL for SQL Server developers, and practical applications of off-the-shelf AI tools. There’s even a full-day container and Kubernetes workshop for those looking to master cloud-native infrastructure. These workshops are designed to be hands-on and immediately applicable, making them ideal for developers aiming to level up their skills.

Across three full days of sessions, attendees will explore topics spanning web development, cloud architecture, DevOps, best practices, and soft skills. With over 70 sessions and dozens of world-class speakers—including Microsoft MVPs and industry veterans—TechBash promises a dynamic and inclusive learning environment. Whether you're a seasoned engineer or attending your first developer conference, TechBash offers a rare blend of technical depth and community spirit.
