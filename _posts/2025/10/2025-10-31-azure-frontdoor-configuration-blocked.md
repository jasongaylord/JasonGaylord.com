A lot of news outlets are talking about the Microsoft Azure outage that occurred on October 29th. This is the second time in the same number of weeks that there was a major cloud outage. So, of course it's news.

What they're failing to report is that for the Microsoft Azure customers that use Azure Frontdoor, configuration changes are currently blocked. Microsoft is making this change as they continue to investigate further. Some customers may still experience periodic issues. Unfortunately, this messaging is buried in the [RCA](https://jasong.us/3X4mQJL) for the issue from 10/29. It's under **What happened?** in paragraph 3.
