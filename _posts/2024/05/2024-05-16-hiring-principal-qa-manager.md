As biBerk and BHDIC continue to grow, we also continue to develop new roles within our organization. Recently we posted a Principal QA Manager role. The Principal QA Manager will be a key member of our technology leadership team, reporting to the head of IT for biBerk. Candidates can work in one of our offices, be remote, or work hybrid. BHDIC is a direct insurance company with offices in Omaha, Nebraska and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

The Principal QA Manager will lead BHDIC's growing team of manual and automated test engineers within a growing technology team of 200+ employees and contractors. The Principal QA Manager will work very closely with our QA Manager and Team Leads to ensure the quality of the software built at BHDIC. Specflow and Postman experience is a huge plus.
