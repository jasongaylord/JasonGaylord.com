TODAY is the day. This is the final day of TechBash 2024 Early Bird tickets. Beginning tomorrow, ticket pricing increases by $100 for all tickets. It's time to register for **TechBash 2024**. 3-day and 4-day early bird tickets are now available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL).

In addition, TechBash has announced two super exciting keynotes and keynote presenters. 

First, Brandon Minnick, a Developer Advocate at AWS, will be giving a talk called _Confusion is the Sweat of Learning_. Join us for this session where we'll discuss how confusion is an important part of the learning process. We'll cover how to identify it, what steps to take when we're confused, and how the act of finding the answer can be more important than the answer itself.

Next up is Maddy Montaquila, a Senior Product Manager of .NET MAUI at Microsoft. Maddy will be presenting _It's not your dad's .NET anymore_. .NET is feeling 22! Since 2002, .NET has grown into the most performant and flexible platform for building any type of app for any device. Target mobile/desktop with .NET MAUI, the web with ASP.NET and Blazor, and even orchestrate your cloud native development and deployment with .NET Aspire.

Don't both talks sound exciting? It's always great to get different perspectives from different technology companies and hearing from both Amazon and Microsoft is just that. Remember, we're back this fall, in-person, at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/3xuwLLA). Join us September 24-27 for great keynotes, workshops, sessions, food, swag, and the best water slides in the Northeast U.S. In addition, get your room at the Kalahari starting at just $184 a night for each night you choose to stay between Monday, September 23rd and Friday, September 27th. This offer ends on August 24th so don't forget and get our guaranteed low rates! [Click here for complete details](https://jasong.us/hotelreg).
