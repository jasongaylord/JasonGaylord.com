We're just 9 days away from the TechBash 2024 hotel discount at the Kalahari Resorts ends. On August 31st, the discount at the Kalahari, which starts at just $184 per night, goes away. While we cannot confirm what the prices will be, history has shown that the price will go up significantly. If you have plans on attending TechBash 2024 or family day on Friday, I'd highly encourage you to book your hotel as soon as possible at [https://jasong.us/hotelreg](https://jasong.us/hotelreg).

In addition, the same day, the TechBash standard pricing expires. This means that tickets will increase by $100. It's now time to register for **TechBash 2024**. 3-day and 4-day early bird tickets are now available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL).

If you're wondering about our line-up, you can check it out by seeing the [full schedule](https://jasong.us/tbschedule) here. 

Want to send your dev team? Reach out to TechBash to ask about discounts for groups of five or more.
