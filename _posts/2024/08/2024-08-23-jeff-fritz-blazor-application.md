We're super excited to have Jeffrey Fritz, Principal Program Manager at Microsoft, back with us this year for TechBash 2024. Jeffrey will be presenting a hands-on workshop on Tuesday, September 24th called **Build Your First Application with Blazor**.

Jeff Fritz is a principal program manager in Microsoft's Developer Division on the .NET Community Team where he leads development of live video and online content. Jeff is the executive producer of the .NET Conf series of online events. He is also a Twitch and YouTube partner as well as the founder of the Live Coders stream team. You can catch Jeff writing .NET Code with GitHub, Visual Studio, and Azure on his video stream called ['Fritz and Friends' at twitch.tv/csharpfritz](https://twitch.tv/csharpfritz).

Here are some more details about Jeffrey's workshop:

> The arrival of WebAssembly begins a new era for .NET web developers, allowing client-side applications written in C# to run directly in the browser. Blazor is a new client-side UI platform from the ASP.NET Core team, offering a productive and powerful way to construct large-scale applications with a modern component-based architecture. It integrates with the wider .NET ecosystem to enable truly full-stack client server development on a single language and runtime, based on modern standards, and able to run in any browser (including mobiles). This workshop will quickly take you from getting started with Blazor basics, right through to building sophisticated UIs using more advanced framework features. Weâ€™ll explore not only the capabilities of Blazor and WebAssembly today, but also the longer-term vision for the future of web apps on .NET.

Don't forget that time is running out to save on standard pricing for TechBash. During the month of August, you can save $100 on all ticket types. It's time to register for a 3-day and 4-day early bird ticket, which is available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL). In addition, our room block at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) expire that same day. After that, expect to pay even more money to enjoy the amenities of the Kalahari.

If you're interested in sending your entire dev team, or even just a group of five or more, be sure to reach out to [the TechBash Groups email](mailto:groups@techbash.com).
