What's better than one great presenter? How about two great presenters! Erissa Duvall and Nicole Tibaldi will be tag teaming a workshop duo. Both will be presenting a workshop on Tuesday, September 24th. Erissa will kick things off by presenting **Accessibility Testing with Screen Readers & More Workshop**. Nicole will follow with a **Public speaking and presentation workshop**. 

Erissa Duvall is an Accessibility Ally and Engineer. She's also a Microsoft MVP. Here is more about Erissa's talk:

> Accessibility Testing is an interesting process involving a mixture of automated and manual testing methods with a variety of tools. You may have an Accessibility test plan together, but now you need the tools to put it to use.
> 
> In this half day workshop, we'll get into how we can use screen readers in mobile and desktop environments to identify how accessible content is. Additionally, we'll touch on a few other tools that can be used like browser extensions, bookmarklets, and desktop applications.

Nicole Tibaldi is a Senior Engineering Manager at The New York Times. Nicole has presented numerous times at TechBash and had previously worked at CircleCI and Gatsby. Here is more about Nicole's talk:

> As engineers, we're often presented with opportunities to share our work with others in a range of settings, from knowledge-sharing sessions with other engineers, to presentations for cross-functional partners and stakeholders, to speaking at conferences, and everything in between.
> 
> Giving an effective presentation is an important skill, but it's one that's rarely taught with intention. In this workshop, we'll cover: how to choose an appropriate topic for the forum you have in mind, how to organize information effectively, how to tailor your content to your specific audience, how to capture the attention of your attendees, and how to prepare in a way that will reduce your anxiety and set you up for success.
> 
> No advance preparation is needed, and you'll leave with everything you need to start preparing a presentation of your own.

Don't forget that time is running out to save on standard pricing for TechBash. During the month of August, you can save $100 on all ticket types. It's time to register for a 3-day and 4-day early bird ticket, which is available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL). In addition, our room block at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) expire that same day. After that, expect to pay even more money to enjoy the amenities of the Kalahari.
