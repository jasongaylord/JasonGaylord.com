On Wednesday, September 25, Brandon Minnick, a Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services, will be at TechBash presenting one of our keynotes. His talk is called **"Confusion is the Sweat of Learning."** 

Brandon is a Microsoft MVP and a .NET Developer Advocate at AWS where he gets to work closely with the developer community to help fellow mobile app and cloud developers make 5-star apps. Brandon previously worked at Xamarin and Microsoft where he focused on creating mobile apps in C# using Xamarin and .NET MAUI.

Here are some more details about Brandon's talk:

> When learning new skills, at some point, we're likely to find ourselves confused. That perplexion, the murky and unclear state of being out of sorts, can be daunting. The fear of never being able to understand can be hard to overcome, let alone eventually understanding the concept itself.
> 
> However, being confused is more important than you think.
> 
> Join Brandon for this session where he'll discuss how confusion is an important part of the learning process. He'll cover how to identify it, what steps to take when we're confused, and how the act of finding the answer can be more important than the answer itself.

Don't forget that time is running out to save on standard pricing for TechBash. During the month of August, you can save $100 on all ticket types. It's time to register for a 3-day and 4-day early bird ticket, which is available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL). In addition, our room block at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/3xuwLLA) expire that same day. After that, expect to pay even more money to enjoy the amenities of the Kalahari.

If you're interested in sending your entire dev team, or even just a group of five or more, be sure to reach out to [the TechBash Groups email](mailto:groups@techbash.com).
