Did you know that TechBash offers group rates for the events starting at just 5 attendees? It's pretty easy to get setup with group rates. While the maximum discount starts at 10 attendees, we can offer discounts starting at 5 attendees. To get started be sure to reach out to [the TechBash Groups email](mailto:groups@techbash.com).

Don't forget that time is running out to save on standard pricing for TechBash. During the month of August, you can save $100 on all ticket types. It's time to register for a 3-day and 4-day early bird ticket, which is available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL). In addition, our room block at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) expire that same day. After that, expect to pay even more money to enjoy the amenities of the Kalahari.
