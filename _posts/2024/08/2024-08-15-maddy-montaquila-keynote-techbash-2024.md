On Thursday, September 26, Maddy Montaquila, a Senior Product Manager at Microsoft on the .NET team, will be at TechBash presenting one of our keynotes. Her talk is called **"It's not your dad's .NET anymore."** 

Maddy has been with Microsoft since 2018 starting off working on Xamarin and now is focused on .NET MAUI tooling. She first worked with the Xamarin team as a Microsoft intern and realized the impact she could have creating amazing developer tools and frameworks. Maddyâ€™s current focus is on making .NET MAUI developers more productive than ever.

Here are some more details about Maddy's talk:

> .NET is feeling 22! Since 2002, .NET has grown into the most performant and flexible platform for building any type of app for any device. Target mobile/desktop with .NET MAUI, the web with ASP.NET and Blazor, and even orchestrate your cloud native development and deployment with .NET Aspire. .NET 8 was the biggest and best .NET yet - until .NET 9 comes out in November!
> 
> Join Maddy Montaquila, .NET Senior Product Manager, for a whirlwind tour of some of the cool things you can do with .NET, how it all integrates together, .NET 9 updates, and maybe even some history lessons on how all this came about!

Don't forget that time is running out to save on standard pricing for TechBash. During the month of August, you can save $100 on all ticket types. It's time to register for a 3-day and 4-day early bird ticket, which is available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL). In addition, our room block at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) expire that same day. After that, expect to pay even more money to enjoy the amenities of the Kalahari.
