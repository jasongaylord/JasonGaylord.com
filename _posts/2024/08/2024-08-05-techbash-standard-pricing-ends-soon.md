Later this month, the TechBash standard pricing increases by $100 for all tickets. The ticket pricing increases on September 1st. It's now time to register for **TechBash 2024**. 3-day and 4-day early bird tickets are now available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3QoMndL).

In addition to the two keynote presenters, the [full schedule](https://jasong.us/tbschedule) has also been released.
