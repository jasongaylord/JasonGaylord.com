The 2018.2 Philly.NET Code Camp tickets are now on sale for both Friday and Saturday starting at just $20 for Saturday alone. If you obtain a Friday ticket, you will also receive access for the Saturday sessions. Friday is structured very similar to the workshops you would expect to see at [TechBash](http://jasong.us/techbash). These workshops are all day workshops and cover a variety of the hottest topics ranging from [Bots, AI, and Machine Learning](https://jasong.us/2EJPwCL) to [Mastering Git and GitHub with DevOps](https://jasong.us/2RZaEHH). The Friday workshops range from $76-$116. 

You can register for the Code Camp and any of the nine Friday workshops by visiting [https://www.meetup.com/Philly-NET/events/](https://jasong.us/2yJP2pM).
