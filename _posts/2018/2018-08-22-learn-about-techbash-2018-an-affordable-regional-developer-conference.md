First of all, I'd like to thank you in advance for taking the time to hear about TechBash 2018. I would not be writing you today if I didn't personally feel the value in a regional, web and application developer conference. TechBash 2018 will take place October 2nd-5th in Pocono Manor, PA.

At TechBash, we inspire our attendees to build great things that will change the world. The sessions at TechBash 2018 will deliver bleeding edge advances in the coding, designing and development of mobile, web, desktop and SaaS applications. [Our speakers](https://jasong.us/2q2zERh) are world class knowledge experts that you may have seen featured at other well known conferences such as VSLive, Google I/O, Microsoft Build among others. In fact, this year our keynote presenter is [**Scott Hunter**, Director of Program Management on the ASP.NET team at Microsoft](https://jasong.us/2ztxAtE). We continue adding an inclusive variety of speakers and [sessions](https://jasong.us/2xWz9Qw) to the list so check back regularly.

**New this year**: We've added [four pre-conference workshops](https://jasong.us/2SVrBF3).

We’ve built a safe, welcoming and exciting environment that is designed for **all** attendees to get the most out of the event. In the many informative sessions at TechBash, you’ll learn a crazy number of new things, but we know amazing interactions happen outside of the talks too. Our attendee lounge will have plenty of space for you to hang out and talk with old friends and make new ones. Speakers, attendees, and vendors will gather in the lounge to follow up talks after sessions over coffee and snacks. Our awesome, big name vendors will be there, presenting their latest gadgets and code, and a few job listings as well.

Our venue, the Kalahari Resort, is really cool. As a conference attendee, we'd like to invite you to stay onsite at the resort by [using our discount code found here](https://jasong.us/2Akujxl). Last year, with the second expansion phase it has now become the largest indoor waterpark resort in North America at 220,000 square feet. Waterparks aren't your thing? Besides many of the other onsite amenities such as an virtual reality experiences, tree top ropes course, and full service Spa, there are many [other local, family activities](https://jasong.us/2YUxoys). The Kalahari is located in the beautiful Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, less than a 2-hour drive from New York City, Philadelphia, and northern NJ. This location is still within reasonable driving distance of many other cities in the northeast including Boston, Pittsburgh and Washington D.C. Many developer conferences require a cross-country flight and thousands of dollars to attend. Some are even invitation-only. TechBash is different. We're in your backyard, our tickets are a fraction of the cost of those other conferences, and all are welcome. Yet, we have many of the same speakers and sessions.

Haven’t been to any of the previous TechBash events? I'd like to extend a hand to you, especially those of you who haven’t attended a developer conference before or may feel excluded at tech events. TechBash is for everyone, and we’re going to have loads of fun while we learn a ton. [Get TechBash tickets here](https://jasong.us/35Ow8yh). On behalf of the entire group of volunteers that support TechBash, we look forward to seeing you there!
