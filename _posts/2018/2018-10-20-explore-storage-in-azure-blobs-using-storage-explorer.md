Azure has had Storage for a very long time. Typically you would use AZCopy to copy Azure blob storage to your local machine. What you may not know is that Azure Storage Explorer allows you to view your storage as well including uploading, downloading, and copying URLs for your files and folders. Download it today by visiting [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/](https://jasong.us/2OCfsoi "https://jasong.us/2OCfsoi").
