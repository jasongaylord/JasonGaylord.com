The [Wall Street Journal has just posted](https://jasong.us/2ODKTJV) that Amazon has chosen the two city combination of Long Island City, NY and Crystal City, Virginia as the two city second headquarters. This confirms the story that The New York Times reported last week. As Amazon continues with their development, it will be interesting to see when these locations will open and what roles will be located in each location. It's anticipated that the new headquarters will bring over 50,000 new jobs to the two areas combined.
