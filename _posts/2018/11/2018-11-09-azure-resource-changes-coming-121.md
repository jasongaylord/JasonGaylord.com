If you are doing any scripting or integrating using GUIDs and/or resource names, you may want to pay attention. Azure is changing the GUIDs and resource names for several service types on December 1st. Here is a list of what's known so far:

- [Bandwidth Data Tranfer In/Out](https://jasong.us/2FeTVxt)
- [Blob Storage](https://jasong.us/2zPT6Wf)
- [SQL Database Managed Instance](https://jasong.us/2PnfJvG)

In addition, prices will be changing for many other services and in most cases, will be decreasing.
