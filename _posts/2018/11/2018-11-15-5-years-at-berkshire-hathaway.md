Five years ago I started at Berkshire Hathaway. At the time, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was entering an industry that had been relatively stagnant on technology over the years and I was used to working within a cutting edge environment. I spent a good portion of the first two years focused on learning the industry and the types of technology that are being used. About three years ago, I was placed on a project that eventually became the subsidiary that I'm focused on now. Looking back, it's been an amazing journey at the organization. The company that hired me five years ago has tripled in revenue during that time. The new group I'm with now is looking to push the boundaries of technology in insurance. Hopefully after the next five years I look back at the time spent since now and see the transition that has occurred and the new territory that has been uncovered.
