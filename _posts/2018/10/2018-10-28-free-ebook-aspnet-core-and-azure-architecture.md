[Steve Smith](https://jasong.us/2OSjWaj), also known as [Ardalis](https://jasong.us/2qbTcTE), has recently released a free eBook titled *Architecting Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure*. You can obtain this [free eBook here](https://jasong.us/2ArQsXS). The book reviews an online store application sample that demonstrates some of the principles and patterns described in the book. The book follows a monolithic architecture approach, but there is an accompanying book, that [I blogged about here](https://jasong.us/2StgJfp), that discusses microservice-based architecture using the same online store sample.
