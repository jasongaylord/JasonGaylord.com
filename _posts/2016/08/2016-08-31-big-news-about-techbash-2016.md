TechBash 2016 takes place at the Kalahari in the Poconos on September 28-30. Here are 3 great reasons to register for [TechBash](http://jasong.us/tb) 2016:

## 1. The Content is Top Notch
The first and most important reason to attend a tech conference is learning. We've got you covered with some of the best and most knowledgeable speakers from across the country! At TechBash you will get the facts from experts. Learn about web, cloud, DevOps, design patterns, and tools. Want to learn about Microsoft tech like ASP.Net, Azure, C# or Visual Studio? At TechBash you will get expert knowledge and great perspective because we have speakers from inside and outside of Microsoft. Here are some names to get you interested:

**From Microsoft**: Amanda Lange, Chris Risner, Dave Voyles, David Giard, James Tramel, Jeffrey Fritz, Joel Cochran, Pete Brown, Stephen Bohlen

## 2. Location, Location, Location
Our venue, the [Kalahari Resort](http://jasong.us/1kpu06P) is really cool. It's a new Resort, Conference Center, and 100,000 sq. ft. indoor waterpark! TechBash is located in the Pocono Mountains in PA. That means it's not only a beautiful setting, but it's also really close. If you are in the northeast US and tired of flying cross country for tech conferences, TechBash is for you. **We are less than a 2-hour drive from New York City, Philadelphia, and northern NJ**. And this location is still within reasonable driving distance of many other major cities in the northeast, including Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Washington, DC!
