We have announced our second keynote presenter for TechBash 2022. We welcome Crux Conception, a retired detective and hostage negotiator, to the big stage at TechBash. You can read more about Crux's keynote by visiting [jasong.us/3yP5rtr](https://jasong.us/3yP5rtr).

While early bird tickets are now gone, great tickets are available.. 3-day and 4-day early bird tickets are now available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3tFZ5to). We're back this fall, in-person, at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg). Join us November 8-11 for great [keynotes](https://jasong.us/2zAOXZq), [workshops](https://jasong.us/3fGtXBl), sessions, food, swag, and the best water slides in the Northeast U.S. Register soon because early bird rates are valid only through July 6th.

Want to send your dev team? Reach out to TechBash to ask about discounts for groups of five or more.
