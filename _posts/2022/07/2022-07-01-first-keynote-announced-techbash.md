We have announced our first keynote presenter for TechBash 2022. We welcome Jeff Blankenburg from Amazon to the big stage at TechBash. You can read more about Jeff's keynote by visiting [jasong.us/3AhC6bW](https://jasong.us/3AhC6bW).

There's less than one week left until the early bird special ends for TechBash 2022. 3-day and 4-day early bird tickets are now available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3tFZ5to). We're back this fall, in-person, at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg). Join us November 8-11 for great [keynotes](https://jasong.us/2zAOXZq), [workshops](https://jasong.us/3fGtXBl), sessions, food, swag, and the best water slides in the Northeast U.S. Register soon because early bird rates are valid only through July 6th.
