There's only one week left until the early bird special ends for TechBash 2022. 3-day and 4-day early bird tickets are now available on [EventBrite](https://jasong.us/3tFZ5to).

We're back this fall, in-person, at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/3xuwLLA). Join us November 8-11 for great [keynotes](https://jasong.us/2zAOXZq), [workshops](https://jasong.us/3fGtXBl), sessions, food, swag, and the best water slides in the Northeast U.S. Register soon because early bird rates are valid only through July 6th.

Get more information about our speakers, sponsors, hotel rooms, and more on [techbash.com](https://jasong.us/tb).
