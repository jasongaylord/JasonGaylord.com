Our Kalahari Resort and Convention Center discount is going fast and is only _guaranteed_ for another two weeks. There are great rooms still available, but they are going fast. If you are planning on coming to the Kalahari during TechBash, November 8-11, we have discounted rooms starting at just $169 and beginning on that Monday, November 7th with a last possible day to check out of Sunday, November 13th. 

To book a room, **follow the process outlined in our [Stay and Play section](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) of the website**.

The resort has 977 rooms and suites for you to choose from. Water park wristbands are included, but must be requested upon check-in, for up to 4 individuals per room. Additional wristbands can be purchased for an additional fee. Also included in the price is complimentary wireless internet services in guest rooms and meeting space, self-parking, and access to the fitness center. There are multiple restaurants and other activities on site. In addition, we were able to get the resort fee waived for our event giving you the best price possible.
