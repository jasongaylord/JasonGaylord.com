For TechBash 2022, we have some really good sponsors. In fact, we have the most sponsors we've ever had for a TechBash event. Below you'll see some of our current committed sponsors, but great sponsorship opportunities are still available by visiting [https://jasong.us/3KV3HTk](https://jasong.us/3KV3HTk).

In our Platinum sponsorship level, we have Amazon Alexa, Passage, Progress Telerik, and Syncfusion. Each of these organizations will have a booth to share more about their organization and their offerings. In our Gold sponsorship level, we have Cloudinary, The Denzel Group, Text Control, and UNO Platform. We also have some great speaker sponsors. These organizations cover the costs for one or more of our speakers to attend the event. They include iamtimcorey, JetBrains, and The New York Times. For the most current list of our sponsors, visit [techbash.com/#Sponsors](https://jasong.us/3mL7IOF).

We currently have 3-day main conference tickets available as well as the 4-day pass which includes a pre-conference session. Tickets for both the 3-day and 4-day conference passes can be purchased on our [EventBrite page](https://jasong.us/3tFZ5to). We're back this fall, in-person, at the [Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA](https://jasong.us/hotelreg). Great rooms are still available at discounted rates, but are going fast and won't be around forever. To book a room, follow the process outlined in our [Stay and Play section](https://jasong.us/hotelreg) of the website.  Want to send your dev team? Reach out to TechBash to ask about discounts for groups of five or more by emailing groups @ techbash.com.
