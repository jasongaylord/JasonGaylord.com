Earlier today at Microsoft Ignite, Microsoft [had announced a brand new technology called Azure Arc](https://jasong.us/32hjX9y). Azure Arc allows you to take any Azure service deployable to any Kubernetes end point. This includes, but is not limited to deploying Azure SQL and Azure App Services to HPE Greenlink, Amazon AWS, or Google Cloud Platform. This allows a unified multi-cloud, multi-environment offering that can be managed from the same portal.
