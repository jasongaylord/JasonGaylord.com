[TechBash](https://jasong.us/tb) is a conference located in the Poconos and covers a variety of topics including, but not limited to, application and web development, design, QA and test engineering methods, and soft skills. TechBash is now offering single-day tickets for those who cannot attend the 3 or 4 days.

Each single day registration includes breakfast, lunch, coffee, and snacks. It also includes the activities for that individual day. For example:
