Microsoft Build 2019 is now open for registration. Build 2019 is a developer conference that will be taking place in Seattle, WA on May 6-8, 2019.  This year, the cost is $100 cheaper than last year at $2395 per person. You can register by visiting [https://register.build.microsoft.com/](https://register.build.microsoft.com/ "https://jasong.us/2XlgmWO").  One big change to this year's registration is that you can bring two students, aged 14-21, for free to Build. If you have more than two to bring, you can reach out to the Microsoft Build team by reviewing [the FAQ here](https://jasong.us/2EldFfr). However, space is limited and the hotels only accommodate double occupancy so you must act fast.

You can expect to learn more about containers, AI and machine learning, serverless, DevOps, IoT, mixed reality, power platform (Power Apps, Dynamics, etc), and more! The latest information can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build](https://jasong.us/2T1Z3eQ "https://jasong.us/2T1Z3eQ").
