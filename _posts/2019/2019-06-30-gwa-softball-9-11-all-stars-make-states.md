The Greater Wyoming Area softball team that my two girls play on, covering ages 9-11, will be traveling to the Pennsylvania State tournament. Our first game is tentatively scheduled for Friday, July 26th at 4pm. The tournament will be taking place this year in Greenburg, PA, home of the West Point Little League. I'll be posting more fundraising information very soon. However, if you are in or around Januzzi's Pizza in Exeter on July 6th, there will be a fundraiser where 10% of the bill for takeout orders and 20% of the bill for eat in orders will be donated to the GWA Softball team.

Thanks in advance for all of the support we are receiving. We'll keep everyone posted at the State Tournament.
