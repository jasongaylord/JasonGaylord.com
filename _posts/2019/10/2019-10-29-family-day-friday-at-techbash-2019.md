[TechBash 2019](https://jasong.us/tb) is not only the best place in the Northeast to get the best [developer content](https://jasong.us/2xWz9Qw), we have the best content for the whole family! Check out this year's Family Friday agenda:

#### Take a Break! Martial Arts / Board Breaking (Ages 5+)
Ever wanted to chop firewood with your bare hands? While we won't be splitting logs you will get some exercise with an overview of some martial arts techniques. You will then have a chance to test your new skills and break some boards. Take home an awesome new souvenir from the Kalahari: your own kindling! This session will require hands-on physical participation but does not require any previous martial arts experience.

#### Reptile Show
Join [PT Reptiles](https://jasong.us/3dBMNHU) for a LIVE reptile show! Pete will bring a wide assortment of reptiles, and some arachnids, too!

#### Application Development Workshop (Hands-On Lab - Ages 11(ish) and up)
Please come prepared with a laptop running a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). This is a hands-on session and will require typing.  
Powered by [TechGirlz](https://jasong.us/35QzL6P).

#### Engineering Challenge (For kids age 8(ish) and up)
Challenge details provided at TechBash.  
Competitors will work in teams. Up to 4 teams will be able to participate. Teams will be provided with a K'Nex kit to use for the project. Teams will have up to 2 hours to plan and build their projects. No external pieces may be brought to the competition. Each team will need to prepare a presentation (max 2 minutes) on their model and how they answered the challenge.

#### Scavenger Hunt
