I'm hiring a DevOps Engineer for our growing team. This position is for biBERK, a direct insurance company. We're looking for someone interested in creating, modifying, and maintaining continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines within Azure DevOps. This individual will also help to maintain the Azure environments setup by the pipelines and will be using infrastructure-as-code.

This position may also involve consultative work for other Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries.
