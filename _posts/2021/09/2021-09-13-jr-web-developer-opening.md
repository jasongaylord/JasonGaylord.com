I'm hiring a Junior Web Developer for our growing team. This position is for biBerk, a direct insurance company. We're looking for someone interested in writing clean and efficient HTML and CSS. This individual will help to maintain our Content Management System, Intranet, and will gain experience in other areas of the business. While experience with TypeScript, JavaScript, SASS, and CMS systems are preferred, it's not required. As with all of our positions, this position also offers opportunities for growth.
