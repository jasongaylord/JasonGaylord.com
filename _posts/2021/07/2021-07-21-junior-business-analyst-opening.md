I'm hiring for several positions within our growing team at biBerk, a direct insurance company. One of the most recent postings is for a Junior Business Analyst role.

This position will allow someone to grow within the organization by teaching them about commercial property and casualty insurance. This individual will triage and manage tickets submitted by our internal business teams. They will also have the opportunity to write business and reporting requirements and participate in our scrum activities.
