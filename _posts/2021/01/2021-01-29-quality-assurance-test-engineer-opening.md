I'm hiring a Quality Assurance Test Engineer for our growing team. This position is for biBerk, a direct insurance company. I'm looking for a QA Test Engineer who can demonstrate sound experience with Selenium and SpecFlow. Ideally this individual will also be familiar with writing Gherkin tests. Many of our back office applications have either a Microsoft SQL server or Cosmos DB data store and either an ASP.NET MVC or Angular front end. As we continue to revamp our applications, we're automating more and more tests as we move to continuous integration and deployment.
