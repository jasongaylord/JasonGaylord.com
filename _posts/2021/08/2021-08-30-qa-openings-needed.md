I'm hiring a Quality Assurance Test Engineer for our growing team. This position is for biBerk, a direct insurance company. I'm looking for a QA Test Engineer who can demonstrate experience with both manual and automated testing. Anyone with experience in Test Automation Center (TAC), Selenium, SpecFlow, Gherkin, Postman, and other automated tools should apply. Many of our back office applications have either a Microsoft SQL server or Cosmos DB data store and either an ASP.NET MVC or Angular front end. As we continue to revamp our applications, we're automating more and more tests as we move to continuous integration and deployment.
