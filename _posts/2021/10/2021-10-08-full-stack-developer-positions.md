On the heels of our .NET Developer post yesterday, biBerk is continuing their pursuit of candidates. This time, biBerk is looking for full stack developers with a preference towards folks with Angular and .NET Core experience. biBerk is a direct insurance company with offices in Omaha, Nebraska and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 

Many of our back office applications have a Microsoft SQL server backend and an ASP.NET MVC front end. As we continue to revamp our applications, we're moving several of them to Microsoft Azure and rewriting for native cloud. Many of our databases are migrating to Cosmos DB and our apps are using a .NET Core service layer with an Angular front end.
