biBerk is hiring yet again! biBerk is a direct insurance company with offices in Omaha, Nebraska and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. We're hiring additional .NET developers for our growing team. I'm looking for someone who can demonstrate sound experience with C#, ASP.NET MVC, and ideally, .NET Core. Many of our back office applications have a Microsoft SQL server backend and an ASP.NET MVC front end. As we continue to revamp our applications, we're moving several of them to Microsoft Azure and rewriting for native cloud. Many of our databases are migrating to Cosmos DB and our apps are using a .NET Core service layer with an Angular front end.
