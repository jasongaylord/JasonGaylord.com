biBerk is hiring several Business System Analysts. biBerk is a direct insurance company with offices in Omaha, Nebraska and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

We’re looking for several business analysts to join our growing team. More specifically, we’re looking for someone who can demonstrate the ability to work in a team setting and are passionate about technology. This individual must be an outstanding communicator, able to collaborate with others, and have a high attention to detail. If this sounds like you, then we should talk. The ideal candidate has experience in commercial property and casualty insurance, but it’s not required. Remote opportunities are possible.
