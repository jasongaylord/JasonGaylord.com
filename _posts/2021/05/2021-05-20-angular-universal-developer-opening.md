I'm hiring several Angular developers, ideally Angular Universal developers with .NET experience, for our growing team. These positions are with biBerk, a direct insurance company. 

I'm looking for someone who can demonstrate sound experience with Angular 11, C# and .NET Core. Many of our back office applications have a Microsoft SQL server backend and an ASP.NET MVC front end. We recently launched a new back end application using native cloud technologies and targeting Microsoft Azure.
