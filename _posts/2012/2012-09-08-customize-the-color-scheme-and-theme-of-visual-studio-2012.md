During early builds of Visual Studio 2012, many developers griped and complained about the lack of color within the application. By the time VS2012 has RTM'd, two themes shipped with VS2012. There is a light theme and a dark theme.

Recently, the Visual Studio team took this to a whole new level. Not only have they added additional UI update options to the Visual Studio customization options, but they now have seven new themes including a dark background with light editor, a light background with a dark editor, blue, red, purple, green, and tan.

Special thanks to the team for developing this. Hopefully they include it out of the box in a future service pack or other application update.
