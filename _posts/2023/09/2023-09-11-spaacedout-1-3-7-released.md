In May 2020, I [had announced](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn) a new Jekyll theme called [SpaacedOut](https://jasong.us/2ywUm3C). Since that time, I've made a couple of updates for [a 1.1.x version](https://jasong.us/3ehYK5i), [a 1.2.x version](https://jasong.us/3bgqQyZ), and [major version 1.3.x](https://jasong.us/3IkiPbc). [Back in February](https://jasong.us/417J0vq), I released another minor change for the 1.3.x version followed by another minor change this past Friday. This change included:

- Support for `bluesky`, `mastodon`, and `threads` as a social icon
- Update to convert the Twitter bird icon to X
- Update to FontAwesome v6.x icons

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/spaacedout.svg)](https://jasong.us/3bp45GJ)

To install this theme, you have two options:

1. [Install using the spaacedout gem](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-the-spaacedout-gem)
2. [Install using it as a remote theme](https://jasong.us/3fBMNtn#install-using-remote-theme)
