TechBash just announced three amazing keynotes and a Labor Day sale which takes place now through Labor Day, September 4th.

Save $75 on 3-day and 4-day standard registration with **discount code SUMMER75**.

Here are the three keynote presentations:

### Charting Your Course - Kathleen Dollard
The world of tech just keeps moving faster! How am I supposed to keep up? Even the tools I’m familiar with keep changing; evolving.

It is a crazy time for us all, so let’s step back. Let’s start by being awed and inspired. Cloud, chat, data storage, AR/VR and our underlying tools like languages, editors, and source control are not perfect, but they are amazing.

Building on this appreciation, chart a course with a series of small decisions that you make and revise as your tools, environment and ecosystem evolve. If you are smart and confident in your decisions about which technologies, tools and features you embrace, watch, or ignore will let you find perspective and may make your boss think you’re a hero.

### Building and scaling cloud-native intelligent applications on Azure - Scott Hunter and Paul Yuknewicz
Learn how to run cloud-native serverless and container applications in Azure using Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Apps and Azure Functions. We help you choose the right service for your apps. We show you how Azure is the best platform for hosting cloud native and intelligent apps, and an app using Azure OpenAI Service and Azure Data. Learn all the new capabilities of our container platforms including how to deploy, test for scale, monitor, and much more.

### Visual Studio Secrets Uncovered - Mads Kristensen
Visual Studio is one of the largest applications in the world, used by millions of developers every day. It’s no simple task to plan, code, innovate, and release a new version every few weeks. Join Mads as he takes you behind the scenes of how Visual Studio is made, why being customer obsessed changed everything, and other inspiring lessons that can help you build better software.
