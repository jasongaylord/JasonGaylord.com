### Welcome Reception
Following our first full day of sessions on Wednesday, we invite our attendees to enjoy an evening event in our attendee lounge with some light appetizers. Enjoy some time unwinding and getting to know the speakers and other attendees. There’s also a great outdoor space to take in the evening autumn air in the Poconos.

### Family Game Night
Every year, we host Game Night on Thursday in the attendee lounge. We’ll have a wide assortment of tabletop and card games and a ping pong table. We encourage attendees to bring their own games too! Relax with a little friendly competition, collaboration, and snacks too!

### Family Day sessions
Bring your whole family to TechBash. On Friday, we have sessions for the kids! We're getting ready to announce the whole agenda for this year's Family Day. In past years, we've had sessions on Karate, K'Nex building, LEGO, and even a lizard guy! We'll be updating our _schedule_ with the family sessions soon.

### Great food 
The food at the Kalahari is always a highlight for our attendees. We'll have a hot breakfast and lunch daily at the event. Lunches each day are themed. In past years, we've had BBQ picnic, Italian dinner, Fajita Friday, and more. When you register, make sure you indicate any food allergies so the Kalahari staff can accommodate your needs

There are also amazing restaurants at the Kalahari, including a [world-class steakhouse](https://jasong.us/3PGOqtS), a new [Mexican restaurant](https://jasong.us/3PDCMQo), and [Sortino's Italian Kitchen](https://jasong.us/3EGa8aZ).

### Water Park, Arcade, and more!
Home to one of the largest water parks in North America, Kalahari Resort has something for everyone! Splash down from one of the water slides. Challenge your friends in the arcade room at your favorite game, laser tag, mini golf and more. Get lost in the escape room. Our list can just go on and on. Want to escape the Kalahari for a short bit? Within a 15 minute drive, you can visit the Premium Outlets or casino.

### Schedule Using our Mobile App
Yes. We have a mobile app! From there you'll be able to fill out your schedule for the event. This does not commit you to the session, but does provide a friendly reminder as to which session you wanted to attend at a particular time slot.
