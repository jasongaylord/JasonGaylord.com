TweetDeck recently "chose" me to use their new preview. The problem is that I never opted in and it broke Tweeten. Until yesterday, the feature to opt-out of the new TweetDeck was broken.

You can opt-out by going into Settings and Privacy, choosing TweetDeck Version, and selecting to opt-out:

The preview version does not support TweetDeck Teams the same way as the old TweetDeck. Why is this important? If you're like me, you may have multiple Twitter accounts that you tweet from and share. It's nice to be able to have a single "dashboard" to see the feed from multiple accounts. I typically use Tweeten as it provides the TweetDeck functionality as a Windows application for Windows 10 and Windows 11. As a result of the upgrade, Tweeten no longer works:

Even if you revert TweetDeck and try again, you have to delete your local Tweeten data. Doing so forces you to login again and the old TweetDeck API seems to not load, but rather Twitter loads instead. This just seems like yet another reason to not use Twitter.
